According to LuisMi:

I don't know in detail how RedHat 7.2 is configured by default, as I am
using SuSE 7.1

However there are some details you will have to get right:

- the server has to execute the perl programs, it needs the proper settings
  for this to work.  often it only executes programs in /cgi-bin/

- it is better when you have mod_perl installed and use it to run webcal,
  because that is much faster

- for efficient memory allocation and best speed, the webcalSupport module
  has to be loaded by Apache during startup, not in each child process.

For first experiments (to see if you like it, not for the speed test) it
is often sufficient to make sure the webcal programs end up somewhere in
the /cgi-bin/ directory of the server.
This is how webcal is delivered in the .tar.gz files.  it creates a
directory /cgi-bin/calendar where lots of stuff is stored.  Of course
your setup must allow execution of programs there.

We normally use a slightly different setup: with a virtual server that
is configured inside Apache.  It requires that a second name is available
for your server in DNS (no problem if you administer your own domain),
e.g. webcal.your.domain.

Then you can add something like this near the end of httpd.conf:

------------------------------
<VirtualHost 172.20.11.6>
DocumentRoot /XXXX/webcal
ServerName webcal.your.domain
Alias /pic/ "/XXXX/htdocs/pic/"
ScriptAlias /bin/ "/XXXX/webcal/bin/"
<Directory "/XXXX/webcal/bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>
<Directory "/XXXX/webcal">
    Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>
<Location /bin>
    SetHandler  perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::Registry
    Options ExecCGI
    PerlSendHeader On
</Location>
</VirtualHost>
------------------------------

(XXXX is some pathname that you can adapt to your own preferences)

This sets the /bin/ directory to be executable using mod_perl.  The webcal
will now live under http://webcal.your.domain/bin/wcal.pl

We use the following patch to the install program to change the default
locations:

------------------------------

We like this because it keeps webcal in an isolated environment that is
not interacting with the main server (which is used as an Intranet server),
both in configuration and in URL namespace.  When it is required for
performance reasons, the entire virtual server can be moved to a different
physical server.

With the above changes you will be running in mod_perl mode (provided that
mod_perl is installed an basically configured on your server, which it is
when installed on SuSE but I don't know about RedHat).
To preload it during startup, you will need to make a change in the
/etc/httpd/httpd.conf just below where "PerlModule Apache::Registry" is
defined: add a line like:

PerlRequire "/YYYY/startup.pl"
(again YYYY is some directory prefix that you locally choose, could be
/etc/httpd as well for this case)

The file startup.pl then contains:

------------------------------
use lib "/XXXX/webcal/bin";
use webcalSupport;

1;
------------------------------

This file preloads the webcalSupport module (a very large collection of
routines required for webcal runtime) during startup of Apache, compiling
it only once and making it available in all the child processes Apache
forks.

Please report your findings with the above, and anything you need to get
it really working (I copy this from a working installation, but maybe I
forget something).
With some co-operative work we may be able to use it as a mod_perl
installation manual for webcal.
