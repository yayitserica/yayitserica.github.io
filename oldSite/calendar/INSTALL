See APACHE2+MOD_PERL2 if you're running
apache2+mod_perl2 on your system.


 

1. Recommended environment
==========================

 *) Apache with mod_perl extension. Webcalendar
    will run as a pure cgi script, but it is 
    rather slow.

2. Required environment
========================

 *) A web server capable of running perl cgi scripts.

 *) Perl 5.005 or later, with CGI module 2.46 or later. 

 *) Super user privilege. If you don't have that,
    you need to have the privilege to install CGI
    scripts under your main cgi-bin subtree.

 *) The cgi scripts need to be installed on your web
    server.  It needs a spool directory to store user
    calendars.  This spool directory must be owned by 
    the owner of your webserver.

    +----------------------------------------------+
    | You should NOT install webcal in your main   |
    | cgi-bin directory. Install it in a different |
    | cgi directory or a sub directory of cgi-bin. |
    | You may need to reconfigure your webserver   |
    | also.                                        |
    +----------------------------------------------+

 *)   If you need to install webcalendar on multiple 
    virtual servers running on a single physical host, 
    you'll need a separate spool directory for each
    virtual server. If you use the http 'cookie' auth
    method, the cgi scripts can be installed in a 
    single cgi directory and shared by all virtual 
    servers. If you select the htpassword authentication
    method, a separate CGI directory is needed for each
    virtual server. In this case, you may still install
    the cgi script in a single location and use symbolic
    links to link them to the different cgi directories.

3. Install with super user privilege
=====================================

  *) Edit the first section of install.pl, and run 
       perl install.pl
     See sample install scripts in ./examples.
  
4. Install without super user privilege
=====================================

  *) unpack the distribution in your main cgi-bin
     directory. This will create a subdirectory
     webCal2.9.0

  *) Change into this directory, edit the file
     install.pl and

  *) execute the installation script from a browser,
     i.e., visit  
     http://your_webserver/cgi-bin/webCal2.9.0/install.pl
     using your favoriate browser.
