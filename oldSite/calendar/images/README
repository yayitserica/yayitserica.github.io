The 6 navigation GIF images are created from
blank.gif using xpaint.

  English-admin.gif   
  English-compare.gif 
  English-goto_date.gi
  English-logout.gif  
  English-options.gif 
  English-search.gif  

If you create a set of GIF buttons
for your language, name it like
  Language-***.gif
and reinstall. The CGI script will
use them immediately after installation.

Also, please send me a copy of the images
so I can include them in future releases.
