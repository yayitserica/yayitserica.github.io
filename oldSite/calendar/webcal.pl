# mod_perl magic:
#  When run under Apache::Registry, this script is packed as
#    handler() { blah ... the code ... }
#  when invoked, the arg passed is the http request record.
#  We save it as a global var. When done process the request,
#  we'll cache calendar data if needed. Caching maybe time consuming.
#  If done as part of http request processing, it will leave an open
#  socket which makes the client seems hanging (since there will be
#  no data transfer). We'll register a cleanup_handler after processing
#  the request, close the socket and do the caching in the clean up
#  handler. The handler is registered to the request. When finished,
#  it will be destroyed.
